    <td><p title="Overview" id="dancing-script"><font color="white" size="+3">The Crew is an upcoming online racing video game set in an open world environment. It is being developed by Ivory Tower and Ubisoft Reflections and published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, with an Xbox 360 port being developed by Asobo Studio.The Crew is an open and persistent world for racing across the United States. It takes 45 minutes to drive from coast to coast in-game. The single-player campaign is 20 hours long, and entails infiltrating criminal groups with protagonist Alex Taylor (Troy Baker). Players can also participate in mini-games called skills that are peppered across the world. They are triggered when a player drives through them and it involves completing challenges such as weaving through gates and staying as close to a racing line for a period of time. Players' scores are automatically saved so friends can try and beat their scores, in similar fashion to how Autolog works in games of the Need for Speed franchise. Missions can be played alone, with friends, or with online co-op matchmaking. The multiplayer mode lets a maximum of eight players to compete in races and other gametypes. There are no in-game loading screens or pauses. Players can also build cars with a tie-in app for iOS and Android. The Crew creative director Julian Gerighty has called the game a role-playing game with large-scale multiplayer elements. The multiplayer is not separate from the single-player. Players can form "crews" to race together or against ghost records. Though the player can play alone, the game will require an internet connection to play, in a very similar way to another of Ubisoft's upcoming titles, Tom Clancy's The Division.</font></p></td>
